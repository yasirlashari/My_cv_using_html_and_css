 <h2>CRUD_OPERATIONS_USING_REACTJS</h2>
 <p>In this project, I have created a component to represent data and managed it using state
    in React.js. The component efficiently displays the data, making it easily accessible to
    users. I have implemented the create functionality by incorporating a form where users
    can input new data. By handling the form submission, the state is appropriately updated
    with the newly added information. Additionally, the read functionality is achieved by
    dynamically rendering the data in the component, ensuring that users can view the
    existing records. To enable updates, I have included an edit functionality that allows users
    to modify the data within the component. Finally, to provide data deletion capabilities, a
    delete option has been added, allowing users to remove specific data entries from the
    state. By completing these steps, the application now supports comprehensive CRUD
    operations, empowering users to effectively manage and interact with the data.</p>
